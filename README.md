FlappyMonkey
============


With all the "Flappy" Craze, I decided to build one as well. The intial version took about a day. It runs on iOS/Android with only one line of code difference for Ouya.  Enjoy!


Artwork
===========
All of the artwork aside from the monkey and the clouds was hand drawn by me. 
The monkey is a vectorized version of a Xamarin monkey, photographed by Craig Dunn
The clouds, and the font came from http://www.kenney.nl/
